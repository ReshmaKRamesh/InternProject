# InternProject

Create a website, hosted on Vercel, that does the following.

- Pick a blockchain from: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana or Bitcoin. Use their ‘devnet/testnet’

- Build a coinflip game, where the user can connect their wallet and then flip a coin on the screen.

- User can select how much tokens from their wallet (SOL, ETH or BTC) they want to risk, and also select a side.

- If it lands on the side that they chose, they get double their tokens back, if it’s the wrong side, they get nothing.

- Make the UI/UX (design) nice

- You should test the site before submitting, and it should work. I should be able to test and it should give me tokens back
